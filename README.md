# WirelessSensorNetworkOfDust
I developed this program with my team (Budi and Ronald) to sent data sensor of dust through wireless protocol. We used arduino and x-bee to controll data between sensor and receiver. 
Programming: 
  - Phyton (controll stream of data and convert from hexadecimal to string)
  - C (controll arduino and sensor)
  - PHP (Show data to web page real time)
